# Handeck
A lightweight hand-tracking mouse controller built using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It replaces traditional mouse input with real-time hand gestures, supporting cursor movement, left/right click, double click, and scroll actions. Everything runs locally with no external dependencies except normal CV libraries.
